## Customer Segmentation using Clustering

### Purpose of This Notebook

This notebook aims to build a clustering model for performing customer segmentation based on credit card data from a bank. The dataset includes credit card usage information from the past 6 months.

In this notebook, you will:
1. Explore and preprocess the credit card usage data.
2. Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers.
3. Analyze and interpret the resulting customer segments.
4. Visualize the segments to gain insights into customer behavior.
